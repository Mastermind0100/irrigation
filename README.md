# Comprehensive Irrigation System for Domestic Environments
The project involved integrating a soil moisture sensor along with a water level sensor.
The moisture sensor would detect a fall in moisture level to trigger a flow of water from storage, and the water level sensor will detect a fall of water level below a certain level.
The data is transmitted between this IoT based system to a mobile handset using the Twilio api available for Raspberry Pi.
The data can be further implemmented for training fully connected networks to predict the amount of water necessary for this purpose annually.
